To install and play the game, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. Here's how to set up and install the game:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Create a new virtual environment for your project:

    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

   Replace `.venv` with your desired name for the virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment:

      ```
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
4. install `pygame` if you haven't already:

5. Install the game directly from PyPI using pip:

    ```
    pip install runner-game
    ```

6. import the package:

    ```
    import runner_game
    from runner_game import game
    ```
